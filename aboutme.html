        <p>Howdy! My name is Kimberly and I'm an Aggie computer software engineer from Austin, Texas. Outside of school and work, I enjoy art and being active. I played volleyball for 8 years so I love playing sand volleyball with friends. In the summer, I like to spend as much time as I can at the pool, lake, or ocean - basically any body of water I can find. When I'm not outside, you can catch me watching films. The immersiveness and aesthetics of film inspire me to live my own life as passionately as I possibly can. Growing up near Austin with a music-loving family also made me a music fanatic. While I may be a mediocre dancer, I enjoy hooping to music. Hooping is a form of <a href="https://medium.com/@tippykiyay/the-phenomena-of-flow-arts-1936a80c41f2">flow art</a> that I discovered and fell in love with about a year ago.</p>
        <p>One of my biggest interests is video editing. I've been making edits since I discovered iMovie back in elementary school. My current goal is to learn animation so that I can bring new creative life to my work. As a hobby, I'd like to one day create <a href="http://www.cnn.com/2014/11/20/world/the-greatest-stage-spectacles-on-earth/index.html">festival visuals</a> for music artists. They're a popular trend for EDM concerts but I'd like to expand the field and popularize the art in other genres such as rock, R&B, and country. Being so fond of many different visual styles, I seek to experiment with integrating 3D animation, hand drawn art, and live-footage clips in my projects. Once I learn the tools necessary, I hope to develop this art with inspirations drawn from my biggest passions; Art that incorporates the constant flow of water, the changing rythms of music, the intense emotions of film.</p>
